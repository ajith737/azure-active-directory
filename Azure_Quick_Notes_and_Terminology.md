## Azure quick notes and Terminologies

1. Azure Active Directory - a cloud-based identity and access management service
2. IT administrators - use Azure Active Directory to control access to applications and resources
3. Application developers - often use Azure AD as a standards-based approach for adding single sign-on to applications
4. Azure Active Directory Free - offers basic reporting functionality, self-service password change for cloud only users, and single sign-on for Azure, office 365, and numerous other Software-as-a-Service applications
5. Azure Active Directory Premium P1 - offers capabilities like dynamic groups, self-service group management, self-service password reset for on-prem users, and even Microsoft identity manager
6. Azure Active Directory Premium P2 - offers Azure Active Directory identity protection and privileged identity management
7. Azure Active Directory - an identity as a service solution that organizations can use for all applications, whether they are in the cloud or on-prem
8. privileged identity management - allows you to provide just-in-time access, workflow-based access, and time restricted access to privileged roles
9. Azure Active Directory - allows Software-as-a-Service applications to be integrated, provided they support OAuth2, SAML, or WS-* authentication
10. traditional active directory - does not natively support mobile devices without the use of third-party solutions
11. Microsoft InTune - Microsoft’s mobile device management solution
12. traditional active directory - does not support Linux workloads natively without the use of third-party solutions
13. Azure Active Directory Domain Services - is a full-blown managed domain services offering
14. Azure Active Directory Domain Services - features a fully compatible subset of features you'd find in a traditional active directory
15. Kerberos and NTLM - applications can use these protocols for authentication when a user authenticates from an Azure AD domain services joined device
16. self-service password reset - allows users to change their passwords, reset their passwords, and unlock their accounts
17. https://aka.ms/sspr - The URL for the password reset portal
18. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication - requires users to provide a second form of authentication during sign-in
19. global banned password list - used by Azure AD to block weak passwords
20. Passwordless Authentication - When using this authentication method, a user’s credentials are provided via methods like biometrics through Windows hello for business, or through a FIDO2 security key
21. dynamic group - a group whose membership is based on certain rules that you set up
22. Office 365 groups - groups that are used to facilitate collaboration
23. Security group - the type of group that's used to manage access to resources
24. Azure AD RBAC roles - used to control access to Azure AD resources, like users, groups, and applications
25. Azure Active Directory B2B - an offering that you use when you need to share your applications and services with guest users from another organization
26. Azure Active Directory B2C - a business to consumer identity service that you can use to allow your customers to sign on to your applications using their preferred social accounts, enterprise accounts, or local accounts
27. Azure Active Directory Domain Services - is essentially a managed version of a traditional on-prem active directory
28. Kerberos and NTLM authentication - Because Azure Active Directory Domain Services  supports these types of authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows integrated authentication
29. Azure AD connect - a software tool that is used to facilitate hybrid identities
30. Password hash synchronization - a sign-in method that synchronizes a hash of your on-prem AD user passwords with Azure AD
31. Pass-through authentication - allows users to use their on-prem passwords in the cloud without the need for the infrastructure of a federated environment
32. Federation - allows you to leverage an on-prem ADFS infrastructure to configure a hybrid environment
33. Azure AD Connect Health - provides robust monitoring and a central location in your Azure portal to view the health of your Azure AD connect implementation
34. Azure AD Seamless Single Sign-On - automatically signs users in when they are using a corporate device while connected to the corporate network
